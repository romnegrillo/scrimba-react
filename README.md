# Scrimba React Fundamentals

Collection of mini projects I made as I first study React from Scrimba.

I came from using Django alone for building the frontend and backend of 
web applications. I studied React because it's much more scalable and flexible 
if you separate the frontend and backend in such a way that they just communicates
via REST APIs.

Topics covered:
- Local setup
- Why React?
- JSX
- ReactDOM.render()
- Custom components
- Organizing components
- Reusable components
- JS inside JSX
- Props
- Destructuring props
- Rendering arrays
- Mapping components
- Key prop
- Passing objects as props
- Spreading objects as props
- Props vs state
- useState
- useState array destructuring
- Changing state
- Complex state
- Refactoring state
- Passing state as props
- Local state
- Unified state
- Conditional rendering
- React forms
- Forms input
- Forms state object
- Submitting forms in React
- Making API calls
- useEffect
- Async functions inside useEffect
- Local storage with React
- Lazy state initialization
